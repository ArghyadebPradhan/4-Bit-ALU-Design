# 4-Bit-ALU-Design
4-Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

Tools & Tech: Verilog HDL, Xilinx Vivado/>


Project Description:
Designed and implemented a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL, capable of performing arithmetic, logical,
and data manipulation operations. The design was verified through simulation and RTL analysis in Xilinx Vivado to ensure correctness and synthesis readiness.

Key Notes / Highlights:

- Implemented arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Designed logical functions: AND, OR, XOR, and NAND
- Added shift and rotate operations for efficient bit-level data manipulation
- Used opcode-based control logic to select ALU operations
- Developed modular and synthesizable RTL architecture
- Created and executed testbenches for functional verification
- Performed RTL simulation and waveform analysis in Xilinx Vivado
